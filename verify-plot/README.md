# Plot Verification QR Code Feature

This feature allows users to verify plot ownership by scanning a QR code. When scanned, the QR code directs users to this verification page which displays official plot ownership information.

## How It Works

1. A QR code is generated by the backend containing an encrypted verification token
2. When scanned, the QR code directs to: `https://your-domain.com/verify-plot?qr=ENCRYPTED_TOKEN`
3. The frontend sends this token to the backend API for verification
4. The backend decrypts and validates the token, returning plot and owner information
5. The frontend displays this information in a professional, official-looking certificate

## API Integration

The frontend makes a request to the backend API endpoint:
```
GET /verify-plot-confirmation-letter?qr=ENCRYPTED_TOKEN
```

### Expected Response Format

```json
{
  "message": "QR has been verified.",
  "data": {
    "name": "Owner Name",
    "cnic": "1234567890123",
    "plot_no": "123",
    "size": "1800",
    "category": "Commercial"
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Set the backend API URL in your `.env.local` file:
```
BACKEND_API_URL=https://your-backend-api.com
```

## Testing

You can test this feature by:
1. Generating a QR code from the backend
2. Scanning the QR code with a mobile device
3. Verifying that the plot information displays correctly
