Subject: URGENT: Property Update API Failing - Invalid Validation Rule

Hi Backend Team,

The property update API is currently failing in production with a 500 error. Users cannot update their properties.

ERROR:
Method Illuminate\Validation\Validator::validateSometimesIf does not exist.

CAUSE:
The validation rules are using "sometimes_if" which is not a valid Laravel validation rule.

QUICK FIX:
1. SSH into the server: /var/www/html/dha-marketplace-backend
2. Find the validation file:
   grep -rn "sometimes_if" app/

3. Replace "sometimes_if" with "required_if":
   
   BEFORE:
   'rent_price' => 'sometimes_if:purpose,Rent|required'
   
   AFTER:
   'rent_price' => 'required_if:purpose,Rent|nullable|numeric|min:0'

4. Clear cache:
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan route:clear

AFFECTED ENDPOINT:
POST /api/update/property/{id}

DOCUMENTATION:
I've created detailed documentation in the project repository:
- BACKEND_FIX_REQUIRED.md (full details)
- UpdatePropertyRequest_FIXED_EXAMPLE.php (working example)
- SHARE_WITH_BACKEND_TEAM.md (quick reference)

PRIORITY: CRITICAL
This is blocking all property updates in production.

Please let me know once this is fixed so we can test.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
