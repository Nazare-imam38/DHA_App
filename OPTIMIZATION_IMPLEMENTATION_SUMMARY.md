## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **BLoC Pattern Implementation**
```
PlotsBloc
├── Events (LoadPlotsEvent, FilterPlotsEvent, etc.)
├── States (PlotsLoading, PlotsLoaded, PlotsError, etc.)
└── Business Logic (Viewport optimization, caching, filtering)
```

### **Caching Strategy**
```
Multi-Level Cache
├── Level 1: Basic plot info (all zoom levels)
├── Level 2: Simplified polygons (zoom 8-12)
├── Level 3: Detailed polygons (zoom 13+)
└── Level 4: Full GeoJSON (zoom 15+)
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
```
PerformanceService
├── Load time tracking
├── Memory usage monitoring
├── Cache hit rate analysis
├── User interaction analytics
└── Error tracking and reporting
```
